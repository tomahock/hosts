# Hosts #
A curated list of hosts to use when the internet is broken!

## Why? ##

You know what to blame when something is broken! *D*omain *N*ame *S*ystem or what you probably know as *DNS*! You also probably hear about some [DDoS](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/08/inside-the-attack-that-almost-broke-the-internet/) [DNS](https://business.kaspersky.com/root-servers-ddos/4978/) [Attacks](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/).

## How? ##
I have my own [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) instance that uses [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html). All my devices are configured to have their nameservers pointed to my pi-hole. Dnsmasq allows to have extra hosts files. So on my rPi I have this repo with a cronjob that refreshes this hosts list and commits to this repo! You can get your own rPi running pi-hole and add this host file by just adding it on the dnsmasq config!
You can also just copy paste to `/etc/hosts` :)

## Domains ##
The domain list it's a personal list of must have ips! If you want to have another domain here just Pull Request the domain.txt!
